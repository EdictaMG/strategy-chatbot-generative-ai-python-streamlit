# StrategyBot: Strategy Guidance Chatbot in Streamlit

This repository contains **StrategyBot**, a chatbot built with Python and Streamlit to support users in navigating strategy-related questions. The chatbot draws from two publicly available strategy documents in PDF format and provides guidance based on their content.

## Approach

To build the chatbot, I used two strategy documents as the knowledge base and parsed them using `SimpleDirectoryReader` from **LlamaIndex**. The app allows users to interact with the documents through a chat interface, ask follow-up questions, and receive context-aware answers grounded in the content of the PDFs.

Additional features include:
- **Feedback collection**: Users can rate answers with a thumbs up/down.
- **Conversation logging**: Questions, answers, timestamps, and feedback are recorded and appended to a `.csv` file.
- **Data export**: The collected interaction data can be used for analysis and future improvements.
- **Session control**: Users can refresh the chat at any time to start a new session.

## Preview

Hereâ€™s a screenshot of the deployed Streamlit app showing the user interface:
